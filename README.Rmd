`spplist` = get you some species lists

here's how i'm thinking about the workflow:

* search, retrieve list
* parse to certain rank (limited to spp vs genus)
* clean names - capitalization, etc.
* write to csv/etc.

Thoughts?

## Installation

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("sckott/spplist")
```

```{r}
library("spplist")
```

## Get a spp list from iDigBio

via the `spocc` package

```{r}
geometry <- "POLYGON((8.98 48.05,15.66 48.05,15.66 45.40,8.98 45.40,8.98 48.05))"
spp_list(geometry = geometry, from = "idigbio", limit = 20)
```

Get a list from many sources

```{r}
geometry <- "POLYGON((8.98 48.05,15.66 48.05,15.66 45.40,8.98 45.40,8.98 48.05))"
spp_list(geometry = geometry, from = c("idigbio", "inat"), limit = 20)
```

> note how the limit parameter doesn't necessarily give you the number you request. Rather, 
that number is the max occurrence records pulled down, and there could be duplicate 
names.

## Get species lists from GBIF

using `rgbif`

Search by geometry

```{r}
geometry <- "POLYGON((8.98 48.05,15.66 48.05,15.66 45.40,8.98 45.40,8.98 48.05))"
spp_list_gbif(geometry = geometry, limit = 20)
```

Search by country

```{r}
(res <- spp_list_gbif(country = 'US', limit = 20))
```
